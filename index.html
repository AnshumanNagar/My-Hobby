		<h1>Hi</h1>
		<div class="line"></div>
		<p>Football is my favourite hobby. It's a team sport, in which you can score only by placing the ball inside the goal of the opposite team. Teams content 11 players – field players and a goalkeeper. ... He's the only person that can touch the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty area.Personally I play football for both training and
			fun. Many contacts with the ball improve the
			technique, and moving on the pitch builds the
			condition. Additionaly scoring a goal or
			blocking a dangerous shot is a really nice
			feeling, what makes football a good game for
			minimizing the stress. It’s good to have an onfield idol, that you can watch to improve your
			skills. My idol is Kaka’, because I love the way
			he dribbles and passes.<br><br>While playing, you must remember that
			football is a team game. Individual actions
			may be satisfying, but there’s more pleasure
			from the game when you remember about the
			teamwork. Moreover playing as a team is
			much more effective, and when there’s
			chemistry between the teammates, you can
			beat stronger or even more skilled oponents.
			Football is based on teamwork and that’s the
			best part of it in my opinion.</p>
